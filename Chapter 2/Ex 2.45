Right-split and up-split can be expressed as instances of a general splitting
operation. Define a procedure split with the property that evaluating

(define (right-split painter n)
 (if (= n 0)
 painter
 (let ((smaller (right-split painter (- n 1))))
 (beside painter (below smaller smaller)))))
 
 (define (split proc1 proc2)
   (define (rec painter n)
   (if (= n 0)
        painter
      (let ((part (split painter (- n 1))))
      (proc1 painter (proc2 part part)))))
 rec)
