a) Write the corresponding selectors left-branch and right-branch, which return the branches of a
mobile, and branch-length and branch-structure, which return the components of a branch
(define (left-branch x) (car x))
(define (right-branch x) (car (cdr x)))

(define (branch-length x) (car x))
(define (branch-structure x) (car (cdr x)))

b)
(define (total-weight mobile)
   (let ((right (right-branch mobile))
         (left (left-branch mobile)))
         (+ (branch-structure right)
            (branch-structure left))))
