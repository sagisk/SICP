Show that we can represent pairs of nonnegative integers using only numbers and arithmetic
operations if we represent the pair a and b as the integer that is the product 2a 3b. Give the corresponding
definitions of the procedures cons, car, and cdr. 

(define (exp base power)
  (cond ((= power 0) 1))
        ((= power 1) base))
        (* base (exp base (- power 1))

        
(define (cons a b) 
   (* (exp 2 a) (exp 3 b)))
(define (car a) 
  (define (divisble-by-3? x) 
     (= (remainder x 3) 0)) 
   (if (divisble-by-3? a) 
     (car (/ a 3)) 
     (/ (log a) (log 2))))
