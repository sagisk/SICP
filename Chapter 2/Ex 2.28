Write a procedure fringe that takes as argument a tree (represented as a list) and returns a
list whose elements are all the leaves of the tree arranged in left-to-right order

;;cope with one list not with (fringe (list x x))
(define (fringe item)
  (cond ((null? item) '())
        ((not (pair? item)) item)
        (else (append (car x)
                            (fringe (cdr x))))))
                            
 ;; modified version
